# Vehicle Detection

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to HOG feature vector. 
* Normalize features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.


## Code

Entire vehicle detection pipeline is in the IPython notebook `vehicle_detection.ipynb`. Supporting lane lines detection code is in subdir `./lanelines`
