    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this step is contained in the `./lane_lines_2/calibration.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I start by preparing \"object points\", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result: \n",

While woring with challenge video, my code started crashing, perhaps due to inability to handle missing/crooked/patchy lane lines. As an exception, I chose to return original image in these instances. This need further processing. My initial thoughts on this are basing output on previous image lane predictions.\n",
